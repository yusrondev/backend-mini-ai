Project: AI-Powered CV & Project Evaluator
Author: Yusron Laksono

Overview:
This project implements a backend service to evaluate candidate CVs and project reports against job requirements using LLMs.

Design Decisions:
- Backend framework: Express.js
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API
- Vector DB: Simple in-memory embeddings for job description
- Async Handling: Queued tasks simulated with setTimeout
- Error Handling: Retry mechanism + fallback response

Scoring Implementation:
1. Correctness:
   - Implemented prompt design for CV extraction and project evaluation.
   - LLM chaining used (CV → evaluation → refinement).
   - Basic RAG with vector DB (job description stored and retrieved).

2. Code Quality:
   - Modular structure with routes, services, and utils.
   - Added comments and clear separation of concerns.

3. Resilience:
   - Simulated retry/backoff when LLM call fails.
   - Status endpoints (`/evaluate` + `/result/:id`) for long-running tasks.

4. Documentation:
   - README explains setup, architecture, and trade-offs.
   - Included Postman collection for testing.

5. Creativity:
   - Added extra feature: authentication middleware for `/evaluate`.
   - Dockerfile for containerization.

Limitations:
- Vector DB simplified, not production-grade.
- LLM responses mocked when API unavailable.
